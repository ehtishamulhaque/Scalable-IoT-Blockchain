# Title: 
Scalable and Storage Efficient Edge IoT blockchain architecture using Delegated Proof of Stake


# Problem Statement
The growing adoption of blockchain technology and IoT systems has led to the need for scalable and secure data management solutions. This research aims to address the scalability and storage capacity limitations of blockchain-based IoT systems while providing secure and tamper-proof data management. We propose an innovative architecture that leverages off-chain storage, sharding, and a lightweight consensus mechanism, such as Delegated proof of stake to improve the efficiency, security, traceability and scalability of data collected from IoT sensors.

# Proposed Architecture
Our proposed architecture consists of a blockchain-based core network that handles the management of transactions and smart contracts, and off-chain storage solutions that enable the storage of large data sets generated by IoT sensors. Sharding is used to divide the network into smaller partitions, each with its own set of nodes that handle transactions for a subset of IoT devices. The consensus mechanism used is Delegated proof of stake, which enables efficient and secure validation of transactions while reducing the computational overhead.
